# This creates a hangman game where the user has 6 guesses to correctly guess a random word chosen by the CPU. 
# A form of Agile development testing was done by playing games where the answer was correctly guess in under 6 attempts and a Winner screen was shown. Testing was also conducted on incorrect words and a loser screen being shown after 6 attempts. As issues were found during testing I would go back and reread my code to see what tweaks could be made
# Download zip file into a directory that can be opened by an IDLE.
# To play, enter one letter and press the "Guess" button. If the guess is in the secret word, it will be added to the screen to show where it is located in the secret word. If the guess is wrong, one limb is added to the Hangman. Once the entire Hangman is drawn or the correct word is guessed, the game is over.

# This creates a hangman game where the user has 6 guesses to correctly guess a random word chosen by the CPU. 
# A form of Agile development testing was done by playing games where the answer was correctly guess in under 6 attempts and a Winner screen was shown. Testing was also conducted on incorrect words and a loser screen being shown after 6 attempts. As issues were found during testing I would go back and reread my code to see what tweaks could be made
